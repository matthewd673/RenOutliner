*Quickly outline large images*

**[Download from my website](http://f.mattdaly.xyz/RenOutliner.exe)**, or build it yourself in VS19

### Usage

- Paste an image from your clipboard with the `Paste Image` button
- Begin drawing a line, breaking it if necessary with `Break Line`
- Copy the finished image to the clipboard with `Copy Image`


Render panel stretches as large as the image, maximize the window if you need more room
